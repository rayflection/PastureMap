# PastureMap
PastureMap coding exercise

Still to do:
1. Move the size lable around when the fence posts move
2. Store the pastures locally to survive session
3. Get user's location from CLLocationManager, not hardcoded
4. Allow user to Cancel from creating a pasture, delete last post
5. Check for lines crossing, warn user about invalid post positioning.
